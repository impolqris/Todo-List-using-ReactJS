# Hi, I'm polaris ðŸ‘‹ðŸ’»
Following a tutorial in a book I am reading, this project was designed through the process of learning React States, Components, and the use of props. I hope this Open Source Project can contribute to someone else's learning as I used previously learned techniques in ChakraUI that may be helpful for others. 

## ðŸ’» Frameworks used to build this Project
This is written using ReactJS ^18.1.0, ChakraUI ^2.2.1, CSS3, and some much-needed dependencies for this to work.
